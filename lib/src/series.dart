   * An array of data points for the series. The points can be given in three ways:
 <ol>
 	<li>An array of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values will 
 	be interpreted as y values, and x values will be automatically calculated,
 	either starting at 0 and incrementing by 1, or from <code>pointStart</code> 
 	and <code>pointInterval</code> given in the plotOptions. If the axis is
 	has categories, these will be used. This option is not available for range series. Example:
<pre>data: [0, 5, 3, 5]</pre>
 	</li>
 	<li><p>An array of arrays with two values. In this case, the first value is the
 	x value and the second is the y value. If the first value is a string, it is
 	applied as the name of the point, and the x value is incremented following
 	the above rules.</p>
<p>For range series, the arrays will be interpreted as <code>[x, low, high]</code>. In this cases, the X value can be skipped altogether to make use of <code>pointStart</code> and <code>pointRange</code>.</p>

 Example:
<pre>data: [[5, 2], [6, 3], [8, 2]]</pre></li>


<li><p>An array of objects with named values. In this case the objects are
 	point configuration objects as seen below.</p>

<p>Range series values are given by <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>.</p>

Example:
<pre>data: [{
	name: 'Point 1',
	color: '#00FF00',
	y: 0
}, {
	name: 'Point 2',
	color: '#FF00FF',
	y: 5
}]</pre></li>
 </ol>

<p>Note that line series and derived types like spline and area, require data to be sorted by X because it interpolates mouse coordinates for the tooltip. Column and scatter series, where each point has its own mouse event, does not require sorting.</p>
